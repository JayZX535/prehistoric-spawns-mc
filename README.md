# Prehistoric Spawns (A Fossils and Archeology Add-On)
Documentation, issues, and extra configurations for the Prehistoric Spawns Minecraft mod.

Welcome to the Prehistoric Spawns github!  Here, you can find information about the mod, as well as prebuilt configuration files for you to use.  These files can be imported into your Minecraft Forge profile's config folder and used to add spawns to various biomes, as well as configuring their rates.  You can see information about each of these files below.

IMPORTANT: No matter which version of the config you download, you MUST rename it to "prehistoric-spawns.json" (no quotation marks), or it will NOT be recognized by the mod and a new defalt configuration will be generated!

# prehistoric-spawns-vanilla
This file contains the default settings for vanilla biomes ONLY.  It is the same file that the mod generates by default when no config file is found, provided that Biomes O'Plenty is not installed.  You can download it here on github, or it will be generated automatically when the mod is loaded for the first time without Biomes O'Plenty installed.

# prehistoric-spawns-bop
This file contains the default settings for vanilla biomes AND Biomes O'Plenty biomes.  It is the same file that the mod generates by default when no file is found and Biomes O'Plenty is detected as installed.  You can download it here on github, or it will be generated automatically when the mod is loaded for the first time with Biomes O'Plenty installed.
